                    <h2>THE HISTORY OF THE FACULTY OF APPLIED SCIENCES</h2>
                    <p>The Faculty of Applied Sciences of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka was
initially started as the Buttala Affiliated University College (BAUC) on 21st June, 1993.
The BAUC offered two diploma courses, one in Food Science and Technology and
the other in English Language. With the elevation of the Affiliated University
Colleges to fully fledged national Universities in early 1996, three Affiliated
University Colleges; Sabaragamuwa Affiliated University College, Uva Affiliated
University College and Buttala Affiliated University College were amalgamated to
form the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka and the BAUC became the Faculty
of Applied Sciences of the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. With effect from
March 2008, the faculty has been relocated in the main university premises at
Belihuloya.</p> <br>
<h2>PRESENT SITUATION</h2>
<p>The Faculty of Applied Sciences comprises five departments; The Department of
Natural Resources, The Department of Physical Sciences & Technology, Department
of Food Science & Technology, The Department of Computing & Information
Systems and The Department of Sport Sciences and Physical Education. The Faculty
offers B.Sc. (Honours) degree programs in Food Science and Technology,
Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Chemical Technology,
Computer Science and Technology, Applied Physics, Computing and Information
Systems, Sport Sciences and Management and Physical Education for the students
who gain direct entry to the Faculty on the basis of their performance at the GCE
(Advanced Level) examination. Students for Food Science and Technology degree
program are selected through a separate window from the GCE (Advanced Level)
Bio Science stream, while students selected from the Applied Sciences Window from
the GCE (Advanced Level) bio science stream and GCE (Advanced Level) physical
science stream are entitled for degree program on “Environmental Sciences and
Natural Resources Management” and “Physical Sciences and Technology”
respectively.</p><br><p>
The selection of the students for the B.Sc. degree programs in Sport Sciences and
Management and Physical Education is done on the basis of the G.C.E. (A/L) results
as well as the performance at a selection test. The students who wish to get enrolled
for the degree programs in Sport Sciences and Management and Physical Education
are also required to face an examination for physical fitness in addition to the
(aptitude test) selection test. Even though the faculty conducts four-year (Honours)
degree programs, students who enroll for B.Sc. Degree programs in Environmental
Sciences and Natural Resource Management, and Physical Sciences have an option
to exit at the end of the third year. The degree programs are designed to suit the needs
of the rapidly changing socio economic environment while taking into consideration
employment opportunities for graduates who pass out from the university. The
programs are conducted exclusively in English. The Faculty also contributes to the
development of the community and the nation through its extension and outreach 
programs.</p>
